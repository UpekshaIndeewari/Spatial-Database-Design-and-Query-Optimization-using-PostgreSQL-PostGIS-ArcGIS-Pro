# Spatial Database Design and Query Optimization for Highway Blasting Pre Impact Assessment: A Case Study Using PostgreSQL,  PostGIS and ArcGIS Pro

This project explores the design and implementation of a spatial database using **PostgreSQL** and **PostGIS** and visualization using **ArcGIS Pro**, focusing on assessing the impact of blasting locations in a proposed highway project.

This project is done for ongoing central expressway highway construction project in Sri Lanka which is extended from Kurunegala to Kandy. It involves significant engineering challenges, particularly in the section between chainage CH - 0.0km to CH - 0.8km, where the terrain is dominated by massive, hard rock formations. These formations necessitate the use of explosive blasting for excavation, which poses a potential risk to nearby structures and infrastructure. The primary concern is the impact of these blasting activities on the surrounding environment, including the potential damage to nearby roads, buildings, and other structures.
